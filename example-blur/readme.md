# example-blur 

## Description
This example demonstrates two different blur methods (gaussian and normalized box) and a method to compute the focus amount of an image.
Focus computation is useful for objects (and especially iris) detection.
You can find more about focus computation on the appendix of *How Iris Recognition Works* by Paul Daugman (p.29).

## Running
Console displays computed focus amount.
Use space bar to toggle between blur methods.
Use 'a' and 'z' to de- / in-crease blur amount.
See the result on focus computation.
